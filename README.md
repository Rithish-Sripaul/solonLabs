# Solon Labs

**Solon Labs** is a web application designed to streamline the interaction between doctors and patients. Patients can upload their medical records, test results, and prescriptions to the platform, which doctors can access, review, and update. The platform also includes Machine Learning models for providing a second opinion on specific conditions like skin cancer, lung cancer, and eye problems, helping doctors make more informed decisions.

## Features

- **Patient Portal**: Patients can securely upload test results, prescriptions, and other medical records.
- **Doctor Portal**: Doctors have access to patients' uploaded records and can make updates as needed.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Integrated ML models to provide second opinions on diagnoses related to skin cancer, lung cancer, eye conditions, and more.
- **Efficient Report Management**: All medical records are stored in an organized manner, making it easy for patients to manage their health information.
- **Secure Communication**: Allows doctors and patients to communicate and share updates securely.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap
- **Machine Learning Models**: Skin cancer, lung cancer, eye problems
